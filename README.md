# Study on Mining, Investing & Regulating Cryptocurrencies 

# Description
From the past decade a digital currency came into force which is know as Bitcoin which fall under the category of cryptocurrecy.A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. The first crypto currency "Bitcoin" was invented by a psuedonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.Later on many bitcoins were created like etherium, dogecoin etc. The characteristic or features of the crypto currencies made many people invest in it. Few were successfull and few were went into loss due to unawareness of how to invest. In my research, I have collected information about the cryptocurrencies, how they are generated, stored, regulated, invested. In this I will be discussing about the investing factors and the future of the  cryptocurrencies. 

# Motivation

The study includes brief discussion of the creation of cryptocurrencies, wallets to store the coins, factors that make a user to invest in a crypto currency and the vulnerabilities and countermeasures to the issues,
