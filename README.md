 # A Survey on Mining, Investing, Vulnerabilities & Countermeasures of Cryptocurrencies 

# Description
From the past decade a digital currency came into force which is know as Bitcoin which fall under the category of cryptocurrecy.A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. The first crypto currency "Bitcoin" was invented by a psuedonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.Later on many bitcoins were created like etherium, dogecoin etc. The characteristic or features of the crypto currencies made many people invest in it. Few were successfull and few were went into loss due to unawareness of how to invest. In my research, I have collected information about the cryptocurrencies, how they are generated, stored, regulated, invested. In this I will be discussing about the investing factors and the future of the  cryptocurrencies. 

# Motivation
Being a decentralized type of system and a digital currency Cryptocurrencies can be used as a means of payment or exchange (though that’s not a very practical use today), or as a potential store of value. The volatile nature of the currency, many people investing in it and getting a huge popularity among nations has given interest to research on this topic. The study includes brief discussion of the creation of cryptocurrencies, wallets to store the coins, factors that make a user to invest in a crypto currency and the vulnerabilities and countermeasures to the issues,

1. A user initiates the transaction
2. The initiated transaction will be transfered to a Peer to Peer network.
3. Nodes validate the transaction
4. Few nodes form a block
5. Once after the transaction completes, the miner who have validated the transactions get a reward known a cryptocurrency.

# Vulnerabilities in Cryptocurrencies
* **Double Spending :** Where the use may spend a same coin twice for a single transaction is known as Doubble Spending 
* **Client Side security checks :** Wallet are the things where users store there digital currency and it is mostly prone to attacks by hackers
* **Networking issues :** DDoS is one of the famous attacks in the cryptocurrency network. It is the simplest attack and it would take less cost and great affect on the users
* Other vulnerabilities are like :
  * Volatility
  * Low Scalability
  * Lack of Regulation
# CounterMeasure for vulnerabilities
* Double spending can be reduced when we need to wait for multiple numbers of confirmations before delivering goods or services to the payee.
* Client side attacks can be prevented by having one system in offline such that the hacker could not hack a offline system
* DDoS attacks can be prevented by having the long chains of the transactions such that there would be trust and the  transaction complete safe.
